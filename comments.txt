Abstract: is clear, but now too long by factor 2 (compare those of
other papers, eg SINUM).  Eg sentence 2 onwards of Abs read like Intro
(have too much detail for Abs), could move there.

Suggest you bullet-list the Abs, making eg 5 key pts.
then write/compress afresh.

Use \emph in Abs even more sparingly, ie no more than once.

You cannot say most things, but just have to hit the key results, eg:

"For the case of the ODE having analytic coefficients, we prove the
asymptotic convergence of the Riccati equationâ€™s residual at a rate
that improves as the rate of change of the frequency gets smaller
relative to its magnitude.  We also provide explicit error bounds
given the number of terms in the asymptotic series."
->
"For analytic coefficients we prove that each iteration, up to a
certain maximum, reduces the residual by a factor of order the local
frequency."

This has most of the content, but half the length.
The rate of change of freq was dropped -- too much detail for Abs.

It takes a lot of editing to make a good Abs!

Last sentence of Abs excellent. 2nd-to-last, try to cut down.

cascade name: not bad - feels like shoehorning to make a word,
ie no letter combos in it remind me
of ode, riccati, iteration, defect correction, phase func, adaptive...
How about RPFDC or ARPFDC
or RFPI

INTRO

para 1 great, just minor tweaks.
It was 22 lines, and too wordy.
I cut it to 16. See what you think - as always, one has to let go of
detail that is not essential to the point of the paper at hand.
(even though you'd like to say it in another paper..)

Para 2-3: see .tex
Point is, you need to be ruthless with cutting details, deciding what is essential for reader to be able to move on, and what not (which is cut or postponed to
discussion later).

p.2: you set gamma=0 in WKB but then leave that 

p.2: You write "Then try... and match..."
But this imperative tense is a bit casual, not used in academic
writing.
Suggest "One then tries... and matches..."
or "Assuming ...  one then matches..."




---------- ongoing Alex comments / changes rationale  11/21/22

* Abs claims n is adapted in the Cheby scheme, but it's not, right? Just h?
Please check.

-> n is actually adapted between nmin and nmax, with these being chosen by the
used but having default values of nmin = 16 and nmax = 64. In each iteration,
the number of nodes is doubled.

* apostrophes are too casual ( "method's" etc)

* I am not using the sec 6 list of changes - suggest cut so the
paper looks as it should.

* oscode & related: local vs global h-order (and power of om_0 ?)
needed clarified

* QLM is Newton iter not series, clarified.

* note don't mix \dot{x} and x'

* suggest Bremer's method is not called "the phase function method".

-> Just to explain the choice: this is what Bremer's code repo is called (Phase-functions).

* I corrected prefactor of al''/al in {kummer} to 1/2.

* Check "smoothness" of Fourier xform of log Omega.

* Is our method an "expansion", an "iteration", a "series", a "defect correction" ? It is best to stick to one. I think "iteration" and "defect correction" are clearest.  Hence edits.

* the "structure of this paper" para: note I highlighted *rigorous* analysis.

* Prop 1: why is non-vanishing of x needed given that x+gamma in denominator?
After prop 1: you needed to update the statement about LB on x_j to be about
x_j+gamma.

* D mat, and spectral meth in general, needed a ref; I gave Tref. old book.

* major notation clash between t_i for time-step intervals vs t_j Cheby nodes.
I changed nodes to tau_j, and killed your "set" notation t_n, which also
clashed.

* first eqn in the matching section was wrong - need t as upper limit.

* Demo section:
The ICs cannot be relevant since the iter doesn't control them, right?
Not sure why ICs are given.

* burst eqn you state as m^2-1 upstairs but then state om_max = sqrt(m^2+1) ...
which is it? (inconsistent)

* burst demo: your choice of test interval [0,2] is very wide, with omega dropping by factor 5 over the interval, and having a nearby singularity at +-i.
Yet it still works. But we have to comment about this.

* plots/residual-k-corr.pdf would better label j for iteration not k,
to match paper. We used k as the stopping iter, mostly.
* also for this plot, the y axis is mislabeled. [t_j,t_j+1] is not the
interval used for testing in the text.

* push the boundaries of understanding the k=5 kink in the demo - is it
do to with n=16? or t=+-i nearby poles, with the long interval [0,2] ??

* consider using block 2x2 notation for {discreteodeic} to save vertical space

* fixed om to om^2 in diag term in {discreteode}








====== GENERAL TO DOS

* explain diff btw us and Bremer:
Bremer converts globally to phase func, then solves adaptively on panels over global region, vs we discretize adaptively on panels before converting to phase func.  We patch together solutions at panel level.
Thus no windowing needed.

* Future work:
 - analyse discretized iteration (matvec plus pointwise square).
  (no reason why high-order derivs on p=16 cheby grid should remain accurate!)

* update struct of paper after later edits
