class Solverinfo:
    """
    Class to store information of an ODE solve run. When initialized, it
    computes Chebyshev nodes and differentiation matrices neede for the run
    once and for all.

    Attributes
    ----------
    w, g: callable
        Frequency and friction function associated with the ODE, defined as :math:`\omega` and

        Chebyshev collocation steps. The step will use `nmax` nodes or the

        whichever is smaller. If `nmax` > 2`nini`, collocation steps will be
        attempted with :math:`2^i` `nini` nodes at the ith iteration.

    xpinterp: np.ndarray [float]
        Values of the independent variable evaluated at `p` points 
        over the interval [x, x + `h`] lying in between Chebyshev nodes, where x is the value of the
        independent variable at the start of the current step and `h` is the
        current stepsize. The in-between points :math:`\\tilde{x}_p` are defined by
