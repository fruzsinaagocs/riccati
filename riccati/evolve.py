    """
    Allows continuous evolution between the independent variable values `x0`
    and `x1`. Starting from `x0` and `y = [y0, yd0]`, this function takes a
    Riccati step of size `h` or until `x1` is reached, and updates the
    attributes of `info` such that it can be called inside a `while` loop.
        
    Parameters
    ----------
    info: `Solverinfo` object
        `Solverinfo` object used to read off `info.Dn` for differentiation, and
        `info.wn`, `info.gn` for evaluations of w(x), g(x) over [x0, x0+h].
    x0: float
        Starting value of the independent variable.
    x1: float
        Maximum value of the independent variable. This may not be reached in a
        single step (i.e. a single call of `osc_evolve`), but will not be
        exceeded.
    h: float
        Stepsize. If the step would result in the independent variable
        exceeding `x1`, this will be adjusted.
    y0: np.ndarray [complex]
        Value of the state vector at `x0`.
    epsres: float
        Tolerance for the relative accuracy of Riccati steps.
    epsh: float
        Tolerance for choosing the stepsize for Riccati steps.
    
    Returns
    -------
    success: int
        0 if the step failed, 1 if successful.


    Warnings
    --------
    The user will need to set `info.wn`, `info.gn` correctly, as appropriate
    for a step of size `h`, before this function is called. This can be done by
    e.g. calling `choose_osc_stepsize`.

    Solves y'' + 2gy' + w^2y = 0 on the interval (xi, xf), starting from the
    initial conditions y(xi) = yi, y'(xi) = dyi. Keeps the residual of the ODE
    below eps, and returns an interpolated solution (dense output) at points
    xeval.

    Parameters
    ----------
    info: Solverinfo object
        Objects containing differentiation matrices, etc.
    xi, xf: float
        Solution range.
    yi, dyi: complex
        Initial conditions, value of the dependent variable and its derivative at `xi`.
    eps: float
        Relative tolerance for the local error of both Riccati and Chebyshev type steps.
    epsh: float 
        Relative tolerance for choosing the stepsize of Riccati steps.
    xeval: list 
        List of x-values where the solution is to be interpolated (dense output) and returned.
    hard_stop: bool 
        Whether to force the solver to have a potentially smaller last
        stepsize, in order to stop exactly at `xf` (rather than allowing the
        solver to step over it and get the value of the solution by
        interpolation).
    warn: bool 
        Whether to display warnings, e.g. RuntimeWarnings, during a run. Due to
        the high level of adaptivity in this algorithm, it may throw several
        RuntimeWarnings even in a standard setup as it chooses the type of
        step, stepsize, and other parameters. For this reason, all warnings are
        silenced by default (`warn = False`). Set to `True` if you wish to see
        the warnings.

    Returns
    -------
    xs: list [float]
        Values of the independent variable at the internal steps of the solver.
    ys, dys: list [complex]
        Values of the dependent variable and its derivative at the internal steps of the solver.
    successes: list [int]
        Has elements 1 and 0: 1 denoting each successful step, 0 denoting unsuccessful steps. 
    phases:  list [complex]
        Complex phase of the solution accumulated during each successful Riccati step.
    steptypes: list [int]
        Types of successful steps taken: 1 for Riccati and 0 for Chebyshev. 
    yeval: numpy.array [complex]
        Dense output, i.e. values of the solution at the requested
        independent-variable values specified in `xeval`. If `xeval` was not
        given, then it is an empty numpy array of shape (0,).
